# Installation

## Check out the source


First checkout out the source tree:

```
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/watchkeeper.git
```


## Instructions for deployment

You need to have http://docker.io and http://www.fig.sh/ installed first.

Note you need at least docker 1.5 - use
the [installation notes](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)
on the official docker page to get it set up.

Please read instructions in deployment/README-docker.md for more information.


# Instructions for developers

# Install dependencies



**OSX** Specific notes:

* Download Postgresql.app from http://postgresapp.com/
* Install xcode
* Install pip (sudo easy_install pip)
* Install virtualenv (sudo pip install virtualenv)
* ``export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin/``

**All platforms**:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

### Create your dev profile


```
cd django_project/core/settings
cp dev_timlinux.py dev_${USER}.py
```

Now edit ``dev_<your username>`` setting your database connection details as
needed. We assume you have created a postgres (with postgis extentions)
database somewhere that you can use for your development work. See
[http://postgis.net/install/](http://postgis.net/install/) for details on doing
that.

## Running migrate, collect static, and development server

Prepare your database and static resources by doing this:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd django_project
python manage.py migrate --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}
python manage.py runserver --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=core.settings.dev_${USER}

```
